description: The Julia language aims to give its users the rare combination of exceptional
  performance and expressiveness. Its syntax is similar to MATLAB or Python, but
  its performance is on the order of C, Fortran, or C++. This tutorial provides
  an introduction to Julia, explores its many features, and demonstrates its
  advantages for data science and technical computing more broadly. No prior
  experience with Julia is required.
